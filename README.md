## Problem Statement

This Excel Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of business performance, enabling stakeholders to analyze key metrics such as **Revenue**, **Profit**, **Expenses**, **Category Performance**, and **Region-wise Insights**.

Using Pivot Tables, Charts, and Slicers, the dashboard transforms raw transactional data into actionable insights that help identify high-performing areas, low-performing segments, cost centers, and growth opportunities.
